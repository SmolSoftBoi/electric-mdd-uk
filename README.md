## Development Container
1. Open the repository in VS Code, and select **Reopen in Container**.
2. Wait for dependencies to install with Yarn.
3. Ports `3000` and `6006` are forwarded.
4. Formatting, linting, and type checks run automatically after creation.
5. The Nx CLI is installed globally so you can run `nx` directly.
