## Development Container

1. Open the repository in VS Code, and select **Reopen in Container**.
2. Wait for dependencies to install with Yarn.
3. Ports `3000` and `6006` are forwarded.
4. Formatting, linting, and type checks run automatically after creation.
5. The Nx CLI is installed globally with Yarn so you can run `nx` directly.

## Project Goals

A self-service web and API tool that ensures â‰¥ 99.5% of new-connection quotes use
valid top-line combinations, slashing average quote time and saving on
rejection fees and rework, while meeting engineering, compliance and
observability standards. The project exposes the underlying medical device
dataset through a Next.js and Nx stack, sourced read-only via Prisma to keep
records consistent.

## Contributing

We welcome improvements and bug fixes. Before opening a pull request:

1. Format and lint the code with `yarn lint --fix` and `yarn format`.
2. Check types via `yarn ts:check` and run tests with `yarn test`.
3. Use 2-space indentation and prefer single quotes in TypeScript files.
4. Commit messages should be imperative, and PR titles follow the
   `feat(scope): summary` convention.
5. Label the PR with `release:patch`, `release:minor`, or `release:major` to
   trigger semantic-release.

For questions or new ideas, please open an issue first.
